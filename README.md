A simple F1 fantasy team builder

Try it out here: https://formulab.streamlit.app/

As a Formula 1 fan and data science nerd, when the time came to put together my team for this year's fantasy league, I wrote some code in a Jupyter notebook to run a few numbers and get a sense of what combinations of drivers and teams are possible and how they might perform.

It occured to me that other people might find that useful, so I turned that notebook into a simple Streamlit app. Enjoy!

I haven't decided yet whether or not I'll update the tool as points come in throughout the season. If you'd like that, please let me know and I'll take it in consideration!
